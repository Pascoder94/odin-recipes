        <p> Early references to maccheroni ripieni (stuffed pasta) can be traced back to 1770, but the word cannelloni seems to have appeared at the turn of the 20th century. Manicotti are the American version of cannelloni, though the term may often refer to the actual baked dish. The original difference may be that cannelloni consists of pasta sheets wrapped around the filling, and manicotti is machine-extruded cylinders filled from one end (source:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannelloni" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Wikipedia) </a> </p>
