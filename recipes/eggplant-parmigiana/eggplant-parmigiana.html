    <h2>Also called <em>"The Lasagna of Nature"</em> by food savants all around the globe (literally just me) this dish is more than a pale imitation of the italian lasagna and it absolutely can give it a run for its money!</h2>
    <p>The eggplant parmigiana allegedly takes its name from the Sicilian word <em>"parmiciana"</em> which in dialect refers to the blinds made up of wooden slats stacked on one another, which definitely recalls the way Parmigiana is assembled but Sicily isn't the only region trying to claim ownership over this vegetable lasagna: Emilia Romagna and Campania also would like to throw their hats in the ring and while its origin is in doubt, its success at the table is certain!</p>
