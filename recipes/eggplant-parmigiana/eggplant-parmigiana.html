    <h2 class="quote">Also called <em>"The Lasagna of Nature"</em> by food savants all around the globe (literally just me) this dish is more than a pale imitation of the italian lasagna and it absolutely can give it a run for its money!</h2>
    <p>The eggplant parmigiana allegedly takes its name from the Sicilian word <em>"Palmigiana"</em> which in dialect refers to the blinds made up of wooden slats stacked on one another, but Sicily isn't the only region trying to claim ownership over this vegetable lasagna: Emilia Romagna and Campania also would like to throw their hats in the ring (source: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmigiana#:~:text=Parmigiana%20(%2F%CB%8Cp%C9%91%CB%90rm,with%20fried%2C%20sliced%20eggplant%20layered rel="noopener noreferrer"> Wikipedia </a>) and while its origin is in doubt, its success at the table is certain!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Black Eggplants (1,7kg / 3.75 lbs)</li>
        <li>Fior di latte mozzarella cheese (450g / 1 lb)</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and chop the onion</li>
        <li>Add enough oil to a ot to cover the bottom and heat it up, then add the chopped onion</li>
        <li>Let the onion brown for a couple of minutes, stirring often so it doesn't burn, then add the tomato sauce</li> <img src="eggplant-parmigiana-step-1-to-3.jpg" alt="onions being chopped and tossed in pan with oil with tomato sauce added later on" width="660" height="170">
        <li>Season with salt and add the basil leaves</li>
        <li>Add a little water to the tomato sauce container to rinse it and pour it into the pot. Let it cook for 45-50 mins on low heat</li>
        <li>In the meantime, cut the fiordilatte cheese into small cubes, setting aside one piece that you'll use at the end</li> <img src="eggplant-parmigiana-step-4-to-6.jpg" alt="tomato sauce cooking in a pan with basi leaves. Fioridilatte cheese being chopped into cubes" width="660" height="170">
        <li>Place the cheese cubes to drain in a colander positioned in a bowl</li>
        <li>Cover the colander with plastic wrap and set aside (this will allow excess liquid to drain off)</li>
        <li>Time to wash the eggplants and trim them</li> <img src="eggplant-parmigiana-step-7-to-9.jpg" alt="fiordilatte cubes in a colander being drained.Eggplants being trimmed before being sliced" width="660" height="170">
        <li>Cut them lenghtwise into slices around 0,5cm / 1 quarter of an inch thick </li>
        <li>Once sliced, fry the eggplants in peanut oil (heated to 340°F), immersing a few slices at a time</li>
        <li>As soon as they've turned slightly golden, drain on a tray lined with paper towel</li> <img src="eggplant-parmigiana-step-10-to-12.jpg" alt="eggplants being sliced,fried in oil and laid on a paper towel" width="660" height="170">
        <li>If you run out of space on the tray just place more paper towel on top of the already fried eggplants and create another layer of newly fried ones</li>
        <li>Assemble the parmigiana
            <ol>
                <li>Add tomato sauce to a 33x23cm / 9x13-inch baking dish</li>
                <li>Arrange fried eggplant slices to form a first layer</li>
                <li>Add tomato sauce on top, spread it evenly with a spoon</li>
                <li>sprinkle fiordilatte cubes on top, parmesan cheese and basil leaves</li> <img src="eggplant-parmigiana-15.jpg" alt="baking tray with some tomato sauce inside and sliced eggplants on a side for decoration" width="230" height="170"> <img src="eggplant-parmigiana-16-to-19" alt="first layers of parmigiana assembled in a baking tray" width="230s" height="170">
                <li>Repeat, arranging the eggplant slices in the opposite direction (ie: horizontally then vertically)</li>
                <li>Once you reach the last layer, torn the fiordilatte by hand and spread it evenly on top with parmesan and basil leaves</li> 
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Bake in a conventional oven preheated to 200°C / 390°F for around 30 minutes</li>
        <li>When the parmigiana is finished baking, let it rest for 15-20 minutes before serving</li> 
        </li>
    </ol>
