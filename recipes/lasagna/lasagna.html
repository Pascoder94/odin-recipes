    <h2>If you want to surprise your friends and/or homage your italian heritage you can't go wrong with this easy-to-make dish!</h2>
    <p>Lasagna originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed text about lasagna appears in 1282 in the <em><strong>Memoriali Bolognesi ("Bolognesi Memorials")</strong></em> , in which lasagna was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary; while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century <em><strong>Liber de Coquina</strong></em> (The Book of Cookery). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagna, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets, boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick.Recipes written in the century following the <em><strong>Liber de Coquina</strong></em> recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended. (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasagna" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia)</a></p>
