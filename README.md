GOALS: build a rudimentary recipe website, practice git commits and workflow

RESULTS: Good news is that I am paranoid so I had already practiced a lot with links, images,paragraphs,so on and so forth, even to the point of writing code on paper while at work when I had some free time. Bad news is that I am paranoid so commits gave me a stomachache, I really needed someone to tell me that it's fine to write the word "Lasagna" in a professional setting while discussing coding and I must thank TOP community on discord for being helpful, especially on something that looks so trivial. Commits became easier and easier the more I wrote them and I am looking forward to any kind of feedback. I have definitely spent more time than needed to embellish the look of my recipes with pictures and to give all of my pages a streamlined look, especially considering that CSS is next.

EXTRA: Commit N. 8, 9 and 10 are me panicking because I wrote a typo in a commit, tried to fix it with the next commit and completely messed up the branch so I had to merge them to be in sync again.

CONCLUSION: I want to be more precise in my goals and my results, I want to be less perfectionist and I want to practice more and more commits until they become a second nature.
